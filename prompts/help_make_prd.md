Help me draft a PRD. To ensure alignment with your analytical, technical, and strategic strengths, provide the following details:
# Product Overview
- What is the primary objective of this product/feature?
- What business problem does it solve, and how does it align with the company’s strategic goals?
- Who are the target users/personas? (Include roles, pain points, and key user journeys if available.)

# Scope & Prioritization
- List the key functionalities to include (even if tentative).
- Are there competing priorities or constraints (e.g., time, budget, technical debt)?
- Should we use MoSCoW (Must-have, Should-have, Could-have, Won’t-have) or another prioritization framework?

# Technical & Compliance Context
- What existing systems/APIs will this interact with?
  - Are there technical, security, or legal constraints (e.g., GDPR, cloud infrastructure limitations)?
  - What third-party integrations are required?

# Success Metrics
- Which KPIs will measure success (e.g., user engagement, revenue, performance)?
- How does this product/feature address market gaps or differentiate from competitors?

# Stakeholder Input
- What conflicting stakeholder requirements or concerns exist (e.g., engineering vs. business teams)?
- Are there preferred UX/UI patterns or existing design systems to follow?

# Additional Context
- Attach or reference any existing documentation, user research, or competitor analysis.
- What risks or dependencies are already identified (e.g., upstream/downstream systems)?

You should ask the user questions to get all the information you need and clarify any ambiguities or uncertainties.
Once everything is sorted out provide me the PRD in a markdown file.
The last line of the PRD should be :!Document!
The user should be able to ask follow up questions if needed.
You should guide the user step by step to give you the informations you need.
